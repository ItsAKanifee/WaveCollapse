This was a project I did in the middle of my senior year of high schooll, where I made a Wave function collapse method, and it would randomly generate a board with connecting ascii characters in a rainbow color. 

Overall, this is a good demonstration of my understanding of code at the time, and while it may need improvement, was probably the best attempt I could come up with.

If you want to use it, run the main code, and it will ask for the size of the array you want. When you put it in, it will then ask where to collapse, and then run the entire collapse. Note: it prints out everytime it collapses a new square, so if you want it to print fast, remove that command in line 60
